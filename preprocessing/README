This requires that the following software be previously installed:

OCaml: https://opam.ocaml.org/
Coccinelle: https://github.com/coccinelle/coccinelle
Parmap: https://github.com/rdicosmo/parmap

Parmap can also be installed using opam:

https://opam.ocaml.org/
https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/parmap/

The use of this code on Windows is discouraged, as parmap will not be
available.

PatchNet assumes the availability of python3.

nltk: pip3 install nltk
enchant: pip3 install pyenchant

In python, it is necessary to run

>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('stopwords')

---------------------------------

A typical command line is

   ./getinfo --commit-list <commit list> --git <git path> -o newres

It is possible to specify --nolog to ignore the commit logs, --balance to
produce a balanced dataset by discarding some elements, and -j to indicate
the number of cores to use.

This produces the files newres.tmp (intermediate file), newres.out
(representation of commits) and newres.dict (dictionary for the commits).

For simplicity, the commit list requires labels for both training and
production data, but for production data the labels are ignored.
