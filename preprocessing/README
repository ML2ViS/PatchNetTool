This requires that the following software be previously installed:

OCaml: https://opam.ocaml.org/
Coccinelle: https://github.com/coccinelle/coccinelle
Parmap: https://github.com/rdicosmo/parmap

Parmap can also be installed using opam:

https://opam.ocaml.org/
https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/parmap/

The use of this code on Windows is discouraged, as parmap will not be
available.

---------------------------------

A typical command line is

   ./getinfo --commit-list <commit list> --git <git path>

It is possible to specify --nolog to ignore the commit logs and --balance
to produce a balanced dataset by discarding some elements. Following this,
it is necessary to call ./get_function_calls on the result, which is stored
in newres.out.

All of this is made available in the Makefile.  Specifically, to create a
dataset, type make run after updating COMMITLIST and GITTREE at the top of
the Makefile as desired.  This will put intermediate data in newres.out
newres.dict, and newtxt.out.  The final result will be in the files
newres_funcalls.out and newres.dict.
