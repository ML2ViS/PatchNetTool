This requires that the following software be previously installed:

OCaml: https://opam.ocaml.org/
Coccinelle: https://github.com/coccinelle/coccinelle
Parmap: https://github.com/rdicosmo/parmap

Parmap can also be installed using opam:

https://opam.ocaml.org/
https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/parmap/

The use of this code on Windows is discouraged, as parmap will not be
available.

---------------------------------

A typical command line is

   ./getinfo --commit-list <commit list> --git <git path> -o newres

It is possible to specify --nolog to ignore the commit logs and --balance
to produce a balanced dataset by discarding some elements.

This produces the files newres.tmp (intermediate file), newres.out
(representation of commits) and newres.dict (dictionary for the commits).
